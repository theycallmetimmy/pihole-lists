# pihole-lists
#These lists will contain whitelists and blacklists of websites you might want to add to your pihole install
#
#To use the 1-regex.txt or 1-whitelist.txt files you will need to create a cron job to move the contents 
#to your regex file in your pihole
#directory, or you can just open up the file "/etc/pihole/regex.list" or "/etc/pihole/whitelist.list" 
#in your favorite text editor or Webmin console and copy
#the contents of my list into your list. Save and reboot your pihole.
