# pihole-lists
#These lists will contain whitelists and blacklists of websites you might want to add to your pihole install
#
#To use the regex-wildcard.txt file you will need to create a cron job to move the contents to your regex file in your pihole
#directory, or you can just open up the file "/etc/pihole/regex.list" in your favorite text editor or Webmin console and copy
#the contents of my list into your list. Save and reboot your pihole.
