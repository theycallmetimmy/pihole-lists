#If blocking youtube.com or google.com isn't an option, but you would rather filter the websites instead,
#you will need to alter your raspberry pi hosts file, and add a couple CNAME records.

#First off, access the hosts file in the /etc/ directory on your raspberry pi. No, I'm not telling you how, you should know already.
#This is the full file and directory     /etc/hosts

#Inside the hosts file add the below entries. I have added my own notes to indicate what they are because I have other entries in the file as well

******************host file sample******************
# Redirect to Google SafeSearch
216.239.38.120	WWW.google.com
216.239.38.120	www.google.*

# Redirect to Bing SafeSearch
204.79.197.220	www.bing.com

# Entries to help pihole find filtered servers
# Don't forget to add the CNAME records

#Forcing youtube-safesearch and duckduckgo-safesearch requires adding entries to your pihole admin interface, so browse there next
#example= https://pihole-IP/admin
#Then go to "Local DNS" and under it open up "CNAME Records"
#Here are my entries to force duckduckgo and youtube safe search, make sure each domain matches the target
